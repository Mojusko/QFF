## Installation
First clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Mojusko/QFF.git`

Inside the project directory, run

`pip install -e .`

The `-e` option installs the package in "editable" mode, where pip links to your local copy of the repository, instead of copying the files to the your site-packages directory. That way, a simple `git pull` will update the package.
The project requires Python 3.6, and the dependencies should be installed with the package.

## Usage
from embedding import *
x = torch.random(100,1)
emb = HermiteEmbedding(gamma=0.5, m=100, d=1, groups=None, approx = "hermite")
emb.embed(x)
